[2]  ERROR REPORTING
  
There are three kinds of error: syntax errors, which result in
failure of the function ReadIn [7], execution errors, which
result in abortion and a return to the top level, and internal
errors, which never happen, but would result in leaving the Prolog 
system.  Production of error messages is mediated by the procedure
Report, which pre-emptively crashes the system if errors occur
during initialization.  The procedure Recover [1] produces an
indication of the position of syntax errors.
