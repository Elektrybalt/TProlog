The clauses which constitute the Prolog program are stored in skeletal
form, with each variable replaced either by an anonymous variable or by
a skeletal reference containing an offset from the base of a frame on
the local stack. 
  
Access to the clauses for a predicate is via the atom entry for the
name.  Space occupied by denied clauses is reclaimed when the clause
is no longer in use: this is determined by a reference count maintained
by the stack mechanism [4].
