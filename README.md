TProlog
 
The original Clocksin/Mellish book fascinated me. There where also rumors of a 5th generation computer project in Japan. Both used this mysterious language Prolog. I got my hands onto a printout of some kind of a Prolog Interpreter. I translated it into Modula-2, made it usable and played with it.
I even wrote up a WAM compiler for it.
 
Here it is: TProlog.tgz
